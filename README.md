# DS Fellowship 1 Feedback Dashboard & Report  

This repository houses the complete deliverables for the **Feedback Analysis Dashboard and Report Creation** mini-project, where I analyzed weekly feedback data from a data science fellowship to track fellow performance, engagement, and reflections. Using Excel for data cleaning and Monday.com for dashboard creation, I built an interactive tool to visualize key metrics and generate actionable recommendations to enhance the program.  


## Repo Contents  
- **Cleaned Excel Sheet**: Preprocessed data (free of errors, consistent formatting) ready for dashboard integration.  
- **Monday.com Dashboard Export (PDF)**: An interactive dashboard featuring visualizations like gender distribution, educational backgrounds, feedback ratings, and form submission trends.  
- **Feedback Analysis Report (PDF)**: A 6-page report summarizing insights (e.g., 100% of fellows found daily learning helpful, a 29% drop in form submissions over two days) and recommendations (e.g., diversifying recruitment, boosting collaboration).  


## Key Highlights  
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Uncovered trends like high daily learning effectiveness and geographic interest imbalances (11 applicants from Pakistan vs. 1 from Nigeria).  
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Proposed strategies to address gaps (e.g., increasing Nigerian outreach, fostering deeper peer collaboration).  
- **Professional Execution**: Met all project requirements—including dashboard interactivity, report conciseness, and visual clarity—while demonstrating proficiency in data cleaning, visualization, and insight translation.  


This project showcases core skills for data analysts and program managers: turning raw feedback into meaningful actions to improve learning outcomes.
