# DS Fellowship 1 Feedback Dashboard & Report  

This repository houses the complete deliverables for the **Feedback Analysis Dashboard and Report Creation** mini-project, where I analyzed weekly feedback data from a data science fellowship to track fellow performance, engagement, and reflections. Using Excel for data cleaning and Monday.com for dashboard creation, I built an interactive tool to visualize key metrics and generate actionable recommendations to enhance the program.  


## Folder Structure  
- **`data/`**: Cleaned Excel sheet used to build the dashboard.  
- **`dashboard/`**: Interactive Monday.com dashboard exported as a PDF.  
- **`reports/`**: Final 6-page report summarizing insights and recommendations.  

## Key Files  
- `cleaned_feedback_data.xlsx`: Preprocessed data (error-free, formatted).  
- `DS Fellowship 1 Feedback Dashboard.pdf`: Visual dashboard for tracking fellow engagement.  
- `DS Fellowship 1 Feedback Dashboard Report.pdf`: Actionable insights from feedback data.  

## How to Use  
1. Open the report (`reports/DS Fellowship 1 Feedback Dashboard Report.pdf`) for full analysis.  
2. Explore the dashboard (`dashboard/DS Fellowship 1 Feedback Dashboard.pdf`) for interactive visuals.  
3. Reference the cleaned data (`data/cleaned_feedback_data.xlsx`) for transparency.  



## Key Highlights  
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Uncovered trends like high daily learning effectiveness and geographic interest imbalances (11 applicants from Pakistan vs. 1 from Nigeria).  
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Proposed strategies to address gaps (e.g., increasing Nigerian outreach, fostering deeper peer collaboration).  
- **Professional Execution**: Met all project requirements—including dashboard interactivity, report conciseness, and visual clarity—while demonstrating proficiency in data cleaning, visualization, and insight translation.  


This project showcases core skills for data analysts and program managers: turning raw feedback into meaningful actions to improve learning outcomes.
